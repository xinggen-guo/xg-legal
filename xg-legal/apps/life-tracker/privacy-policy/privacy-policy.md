**Effective date:** 2026-01-19

## 1. Summary
Life Tracker is designed to help you track daily tasks and time. By default, the app is built to work offline and store data on your device.

## 2. Data We Collect
### 2.1 Data you create inside the app
- Tasks, notes, time records, and related metadata you enter.

This data is stored in **local storage** on your device unless you enable a sync feature (if provided in the future).

### 2.2 Personal data
- We do **not** require you to create an account.
- We do **not** ask for your name, phone number, or email for normal app usage.

## 3. How We Use Data
We use your locally stored data only to provide app functionality (showing your records, statistics, and history).

## 4. Sharing of Data
We do **not** sell your data.

We do **not** share your in-app content with third parties unless:
- You explicitly export/share it (e.g., export file, share text).
- It is required by law.

## 5. Third-Party Services
By default, Life Tracker does not include advertising.

If analytics or crash reporting is enabled in a specific build/version, it may collect limited **device data** (such as crash logs, app version, OS version) to improve stability. If you enable such features later, this policy will be updated to list the provider(s).

## 6. Data Retention
Your app content stays on your device until you delete it from inside the app or uninstall the app.

## 7. Security
We use reasonable measures in the app’s design to reduce risk, but no method of storage is 100% secure.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The app is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 9. Your Rights
Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, delete, or export your data. Since the app stores data locally by default, you can typically manage it directly inside the app.
